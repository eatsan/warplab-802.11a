# warplab-802.11a
A simple MATLAB implementation of IEEE 802.11a OFDM PHY to use with Mango Communications WARP Radio v2 hardware. 

Note: 

- This software is tested with WARPLab version 7.4 and WARP FPGA Board v2. (https://www.mangocomm.com/products/boards/warp-fpga-board-v2) Technically it should also work with newer WARPLab versions, but never tested with them. The software does not support WARP v3 hardware, however with a little bit of effort, the software can be adapted to work with v3. 

- I don't have anymore access to WARP hardware, so I cannot develop and test this software more.
