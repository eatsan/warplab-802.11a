# warplab-802.11a
A simple MATLAB implementation of IEEE 802.11a OFDM PHY to use with Mango Communications WARP Radio v2 hardware. 

Note: 

- This software is tested with WARPLab version 7.4 and WARP FPGA Board v2. (https://www.mangocomm.com/products/boards/warp-fpga-board-v2) Technically it should also work with newer WARPLab versions, but never tested with them. The software does not support WARP v3 hardware, however with a little bit of effort, the software can be adapted to work with v3. 

- I don't have anymore access to WARP hardware, so I cannot develop and test this software more. 


HOW-TO:

- This package assumes that your WARP hardware & WARPLab framework is already setup as described in  http://warpproject.org/trac/wiki/WARPLab/QuickStart 
- You can run a simple SISO example using the "EXAMPLE_SISO_1x1.m" file. 
- Similarly, a 2x2 MIMO example is in "EXAMPLE_MIMO_2x2.m" file.

Enjoy!
